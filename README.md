How to build and test Better Explorer
======================================
**You can also download a test build from our website.**

Important: This process includes the installation of Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. It might take a bit of a while!

Anyway, here's how it's done (in just 3 steps!):

1. **Download the builder** Download and install Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. (Can be found with a quick search online.)
The developers use Visual Studio and that is the only way Better Explorer to be built.

2. **Get the source code**
On the top of this page, click on the "ZIP" button to download the latest build in a zip file. Unzip the file into a new, empty folder.

3. **Make the program**
Now that you downloaded and unzipped the source code, open the folder you created and you'll see a bunch of folders and files. Double-click on BExplorer.sln and it will open up in Visual Studio or SharpDevelop. Then, open the Build menu and select "Build Solution". This will make the program, and if any errors occur, check back here soon to see if we posted any fixes.

To access the program, open the BExplorer folder, and then open the BetterExplorer folder. A folder called "bin" should have been created in there. Open that up and then open the "Debug" folder, and ta-da! There it is!

Help with translations
======================

We have had translations made for us, but they're horribly out of date... Some people are still around helping with translations, but we still would like all of the help we would like! Know another language? Why not help us out? Go to https://github.com/JaykeBird/BExplorer_Translations for more instructions.
